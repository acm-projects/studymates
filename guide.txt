How to get the map to work.

Before you even do anything else make sure you are using an emulator that can support 
play features we are using. The latest and greatest pixel phones do not work.
I used a nexus 5X API 28. 

Also double check and make sure the emulator has the latest version of google play
sevices installed. Update it by clicking the three dots in the tool bar to bring up 
the settings menu. Then there will be a tab that says "Google play serivces". click that
and press the update button. Now the phone will open the google play store and you will
have to sign in with a google acccount to finish the instialtion. 

Now you are ready to make the changes in the following files:

First make sure the mark the dependciecs for the google maps flutter widget in 
AndroidManifest.xml. Make sure its the AndroidManifest 
in NameOfYourProjectName/android/app/src/AndroidManifest.xml

Then add the api key in NameOfYourProjectName/pubspec.ymal where
specified in the pubspec.ymal file. The api key is not included because we dont want
random people to steal it. get your own from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key
or text Sid for his.

Then use the code in main.dart to initlize the map.
